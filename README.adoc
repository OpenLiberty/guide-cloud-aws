// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube}
cluster on Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS). 

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks involved in 
deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. If you would like to learn
more about Kubernetes, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^]
guide.

There are different cloud-based solutions for running your Kubernetes workloads.
A cloud-based infrastructure enables you to focus on developing your microservices without worrying about low-level infrastructure details for deployment. Using a cloud helps
you to easily scale and manage your microservices in a high-availability setup.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a managed Kubernetes service called Amazon Elastic Container
Service for {kube} (EKS). EKS simplifies the process of running Kubernetes on AWS without 
needing to install or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. It provides a hosted {kube} 
cluster that you can deploy your microservices to. You will use EKS with Amazon Elastic 
Container Registry (ECR). Amazon ECR is a private registry that is used to store 
and distribute your container images. Note, since EKS is not free, there is a small
cost that is associated with running this guide. See the official
https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/[Amazon EKS pricing^] documentation for more details.

The two microservices you will deploy are called `system` and `inventory`. 
The `system` microservice returns the JVM system properties of the running container. 
It also returns the pod’s name in the HTTP header, making replicas easy to distinguish 
from each other. The `inventory` microservice adds the properties from the `system` microservice 
to the inventory. This demonstrates how communication can be established between pods 
inside a cluster.


// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, the following additional tools need to be installed:

- *Docker:* You need a containerization software for building containers. Kubernetes 
supports various container types, but you will use Docker in this guide. For installation 
instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker^] documentation.

- *kubectl:* You need the Kubernetes command-line tool `kubectl` to interact with your 
Kubernetes cluster. See the official https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl[Install and Set Up kubectl^]
documentation for information about downloading and setting up `kubectl` on your platform.

- *IAM Authenticator:* To allow IAM authentication for your Amazon EKS cluster, you must install the AWS
IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes. Follow the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html[Installing aws-iam-authenticator^]
instructions to install the AWS IAM Authenticator on your platform.. 

- *eksctl:* In this guide, you will use the `eksctl` CLI tool for provisioning your EKS cluster. 
Navigate to the https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases[eksctl releases page^] and 
download the latest stable release. Extract the archive and add the directory with the 
extracted files to your path.

- *AWS CLI:* You will need to use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). To install
the AWS CLI, Python must be installed. See the https://www.python.org/downloads/[Downloading Python^] 
documentation to download the latest version of Python.

After Python is installed, install the AWS CLI by following the instructions in the official
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[Installing the AWS CLI^]
documentation. 

To verify that the AWS CLI is installed correctly, run the following command:

[role=command]
```
aws --version
```

== Creating a Kubernetes cluster on EKS

Before you can deploy your microservices, you must create a {kube} cluster.

// =================================================================================================
// Configuring the AWS CLI
// =================================================================================================

=== Configuring the AWS CLI

After the AWS CLI is installed, it must be configured by running the AWS configure command. 
Before you configure the AWS CLI, you need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
user. Navigate to the https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users[Identity and Access Management^]
users dashboard and create a user through the UI. While creating a user, you must give the 
user `programmatic access` when selecting the AWS access type. You will also be prompted
to add the user to a group. A group allows you to specify permissions for multiple users. 
If you do not have an existing group, you need to create a new one. Be sure to take note
of the `AWS Access Key ID` and `AWS Secret Access Key`.

[role=command]
```
aws configure
```

You will be prompted for several pieces of information, including an `AWS Access Key ID` 
and an `AWS Secret Access Key`. These keys are associated with the AWS Identity and Access
Management (IAM) user that you created.

Next, you will be prompted to enter a region. This region will be the region of the servers where
your requests are sent. Select the region that is closest to you. For a full list of regions, 
see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#eks_region[AWS Regions and Endpoints^].

Finally, enter `json` when you are prompted to enter the output format. 

After you are done filling out this information, the settings are stored in the default 
profile. Anytime that you run an AWS CLI command without specifying a profile, the default 
profile is used. 

// =================================================================================================
// Provisioning a cluster
// =================================================================================================

=== Provisioning a cluster

The `eksctl` CLI tool greatly simplifies the process of creating clusters on EKS. To 
create your cluster, use the `eksctl create cluster` command:

[role=command]
```
eksctl create cluster --name=guide-cluster --nodes=1 --node-type=t2.small
```

Running this command creates a cluster that is called `guide-cluster` that uses a single `t2.small` Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance as the worker node. The `t2.small` EC2 instance is 
not included in the AWS free tier. See the official https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/[Amazon EC2 pricing^]
documentation for more details. When the cluster is created, you see an output similar to the following:

[source, role="no_copy"]
```
[✔]  EKS cluster "guide-cluster" in "us-east-2" region is ready
```

After your cluster is ready, EKS connects `kubectl` to the cluster.
Verify that you're connected to the cluster by checking the cluster's nodes:

[role=command]
```
kubectl get nodes
```

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                            STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION

== Deploying microservices to Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)

In this section, you will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube}
cluster on EKS. You will build and containerize the `system` and `inventory` microservices, 
push them to a container registry, and then deploy them to your {kube} cluster. 

// =================================================================================================
// Building and containerizing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Building and containerizing the microservices

The first step of deploying to {kube} is to build your microservices and containerize them.

The starting Java project, which you can find in the `start` directory, is a multi-module Maven
project. It is made up of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. Each microservice resides in its own directory,
`start/system` and `start/inventory`. Both of these directories contain a Dockerfile, which is necessary
for building the Docker images. If you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles, check out the
https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide.

If you're familiar with Maven and Docker, you might be tempted to run a Maven build first and then
use the `.war` file to build a Docker image. The projects are setup such that this process is automated
as a part of a single Maven build. It is created by using the `dockerfile-maven` plug-in. The plug-in automatically
picks up the Dockerfile that is located in the same directory as its POM file and builds a Docker image from it.

****
[system]#*{win}*#

On the Docker Desktop General Setting page, ensure that the option `Expose daemon on 
tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS` is enabled. This configuration is required by the `dockerfile-maven` 
part of the build.

****

To build these microservices, navigate to the `start` directory and run the following command:

[role=command]
```
mvn package
```

Next, run the `docker build` commands to build container images for your application:
[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
```

The `-t` flag in the `docker build` command allows the Docker image to be labeled (tagged) in the `name[:tag]` format. 
The tag for an image describes the specific image version. If the optional `[:tag]` tag is not specified, the `latest` tag is created by default.

During the build, you see various Docker messages that describe what images are being downloaded and
built. When the build finishes, run the following command to list all local Docker images:

[role=command]
```
docker images
```

Verify that the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images are listed among them, for example:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
REPOSITORY                    TAG
system                        1.0-SNAPSHOT
inventory                     1.0-SNAPSHOT
open-liberty                  latest
----

If you don't see the `system:1.0-SNAPSHOT` and `inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT` images, then check the Maven
build log for any potential errors.

// =================================================================================================
// Pushing the images to a docker registry
// =================================================================================================

=== Pushing the images to a container registry

Pushing the images to a registry allows the cluster to create pods by using your container images. 
The registry that you use is called Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

First, you must authenticate your Docker client to your ECR registry. Start by running the
`get-login` command:
[role=command]
```
aws ecr get-login --no-include-email
```

If you see `Unknown options: --no-include-email`, update your AWS CLI to the latest version. 
The `get-login` command returns a `docker login` command similar to the following:
[source, role="no_copy"]
```
docker login -u AWS -p [password_string] https://[aws_account_id].dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

Run the `docker login` command that is returned to finish authenticating your Docker client.
The `[aws_account_id]` is a unique 12-digit ID that is assigned to every AWS account. You 
will notice this ID in the output from various commands because AWS uses it to differentiate 
your resources from other accounts. 

Next, make a repository to store the `system` and `inventory` images:
[role=command]
```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name awsguide/system
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name awsguide/inventory
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

[source, role="no_copy"]
```
{
    "repository": {
        "registryId": "[aws_account_id]",
        "repositoryName": "awsguide/system",
        "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-2:[aws_account_id]:repository/awsguide/system",
        "createdAt": 1553111916.0,
        "repositoryUri": "[aws_account_id].ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/awsguide/system"
    }
}
```

Take note of the repository URI for both the `system` and `inventory` repositories, as you need 
them when you tag and push your images.

// Tagging images
Next, you need to tag your container images with the relevant data about your registry:

[role=command]
```
docker tag system:1.0-SNAPSHOT [system-repository-uri]:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker tag inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT [inventory-repository-uri]:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

// Pushing images
Finally, push your images to the registry:

[role=command]
```
docker push [system-repository-uri]:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker push [inventory-repository-uri]:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

When you tag and push your images, remember to substitute `[system-repository-uri]` and 
`[inventory-repository-uri]` with the appropriate URI for the system and inventory repositories. 

// =================================================================================================
// Deploying the microservices
// =================================================================================================

=== Deploying the microservices

Now that your container images are built, deploy them using a Kubernetes resource definition.

A Kubernetes resource definition is a yaml file that contains a description of all your 
deployments, services, or any other resources that you want to deploy. All resources can 
also be deleted from the cluster by using the same yaml file that you used to deploy them.
The `kubernetes.yaml` resource definition file is provided for you. If you are interested 
in learning more about the Kubernetes resource definition, check out the 
https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^]
guide.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `kubernetes.yaml` file.#

----

[source, yaml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/kubernetes.yaml[tags=**]
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
The [hotspot=18 hotspot=39]`image` is the name and tag of the container image that you want 
to use for the container. Update the system [hotspot=18]`image` and the inventory [hotspot=39]`image` 
fields to point to your `system` and `inventory` repository URIs.


Run the following commands to deploy the resources as defined in kubernetes.yaml:
[role='command']
```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
```

When the apps are deployed, run the following command to check the status of your pods:
[role='command']
```
kubectl get pods
```

If all the pods are healthy and running, you see an output similar to the following:
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

inventory-deployment-645767664f-nbtd9   1/1       Running   0          15s
----

=== Making requests to the microservices

Take note of the `EXTERNAL-IP` in the output of the following command. It is the 
hostname you will later substitute into `[hostname]`: 
[role=command]
```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Before you can make a request to `[hostname]:31000` or `[hostname]:32000`, you must modify
the security group to allow incoming traffic through ports `31000` and `32000`. To get the 
`group-id` of the security group, use the `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` command:
[role=command]
```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=group-name,Values="*eksctl-guide-cluster-nodegroup*"  --query "SecurityGroups[*].{Name:GroupName,ID:GroupId}"
```

Then, add the following rules to the security group to allow incoming traffic through ports
`31000` and `32000`. Don't forget to substitute `[security-group-id]` for the `ID` in the
output of the previous command.

[role=command]
```
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --protocol tcp --port 31000 --group-id [security-group-id] --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --protocol tcp --port 32000 --group-id [security-group-id] --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

After you are finished adding the inbound rules to the security group, you might need to 
wait a few minutes before you try to access the `system` and `inventory` microservices.

Then, `curl` or visit the following URLs to access your microservices, substituting the 
appropriate hostname:

- `{system-api}`
- `{inventory-api}/system-service`

The first URL returns system properties and the name of the pod in an HTTP header called `X-Pod-Name`.
To view the header, you can use the `-I` option in the `curl` when you make a request to `{system-api}`.
The second URL adds properties from `system-service` to the inventory.

// =================================================================================================

== Testing microservices that are running on AWS EKS

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/pom.xml[tags=**]
----

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the microservices. If a test failure
occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. To run the tests, wait for all pods to be
in the ready state before you proceed further. The default properties that are defined in the [hotspot]`pom.xml`
file are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*                      | *Description*
| [hotspot=34]`cluster.ip`        | IP or hostname for your cluster
| [hotspot=35]`system.kube.service` | Name of the {kube} Service wrapping the `system` pods, `system-service` by default.
| [hotspot=36]`system.node.port`    | The NodePort of the {kube} Service `system-service`, 31000 by default.
| [hotspot=37]`inventory.node.port`    | The NodePort of the {kube} Service `inventory-service`, 32000 by default.
|===

Use the following command to run the integration tests against your cluster. Substitute 
`[hostname]` with the appropriate value:

[role=command]
```
mvn verify -Ddockerfile.skip=true -Dcluster.ip=[hostname]
```

The `dockerfile.skip` parameter is set to `true` to skip building a new container image.

If the tests pass, you see an output for each service similar to the following:

== Deploying new version of system microservice

Optionally, you might want to make changes to your microservice and learn how to redeploy 
the updated version of your microservice. In this section, you will bump the version of 
the `system` microservice to `2.0-SNAPSHOT` and redeploy the new version of the microservice.

Use Maven to repackage your microservice:
[role=command]
```
mvn package
```

Next, build the new version of the container image as `2.0-SNAPSHOT`:
[role=command]
```
docker build -t system:2.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
```

Since you built a new image, it must be pushed to the `awsguide/system` repository
of your container registry again.

// Tagging images
Tag your container image with the relevant data about your registry:

[role=command]
```
docker tag system:2.0-SNAPSHOT [system-repository-uri]:2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

// Pushing images
Push your image to the registry:

[role=command]
```
docker push [system-repository-uri]:2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Update the `system-deployment` deployment to use the new container image that you just
pushed to the registry:

[role=command]
```
kubectl set image deployment/system-deployment system-container=[system-repository-uri]:2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Use the following command to find the name of the pod that is running the `system` microservice:

[role=command]
```
kubectl get pods
```

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-deployment-6fd959cc4-rf2m2   1/1       Running   0          7m
system-deployment-677b9f5d9c-nqzcf     1/1       Running   0          7m
----

Observe that in this case the `system` microservice is running in the pod called 
`system-deployment-677b9f5d9c-nqzcf`. Substitute the name of your pod into the 
following command to see more details about the pod:

[role=command]
```
kubectl describe pod [pod-name]
```

View the events at the bottom of the command's output. Notice that the pod is using the 
new container image `system:2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

// =================================================================================================
// Tear Down
// =================================================================================================

== Tearing down the environment

It is important to clean up your resources when you are finished with the guide so that 
you do not incur additional charges for ongoing service.

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete all {kube} resources 
by running the `kubectl delete` command:
[role='command']
```
kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml
```

Delete the ECR repositories used to store the `system` and `inventory` images:
[role=command]
```
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name awsguide/system --force
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name awsguide/inventory --force
```

Remove your EKS cluster:
[role=command]
```
eksctl delete cluster --name guide-cluster
```


// =================================================================================================
// finish
// =================================================================================================

== Great work! You're done!
