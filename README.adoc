NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form,
view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

// Start the introduction with "You'll explore how to..." or something similarly catchy.
// Write no more than two sentences, with meaningful information on what the user can accomplish
// with this guide.
// Do not start the introduction with "This guide...".
// EXAMPLE: Learn how to create a todo list API as a REST service using JAX-RS, CDI, and Open Liberty.




== What you'll learn

// Write about what the user will learn in a meaningful intro paragraph.
// Follow the intro paragraph with more details of what the user will learn, but still keep it brief.
// See the REST guide at as an exemplar guide.
// https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html
// https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guide-rest-intro

// EXAMPLE:
// =============================================================================
You'll learn how to create a todo list microservice using JAX-RS, CDI and Open Liberty.
You will use Maven throughout the guide to build the microservice and deploy it
to run on the Open Liberty application server.

=== What is JAX-RS
* Add a brief description of JAX-RS

=== What is CDI
* Add a brief description of CDI

=== What is Open Liberty
* Add brief description of Open Liberty, where applicable

Brief description of the todo list micrioservice
// =============================================================================



///////////////////////////
// Getting started
///////////////////////////

// Add this getting started section to your guide if it is applicable.
// Use the following include to pull in the git clone instructions from the guides-common repo.

[role='command']
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/master/gitclone.adoc[]
// This include adoc will have the heading "Getting started".
// If you are not using this command include statement, you'll need to add it as a subheading,
// ie, "== Getting started".




///////////////////////////
// Try what you’ll build
///////////////////////////

// This is a subsection of the "Getting started" section above. It should briefly walk the user
// through how to setup everything in the "finish" directory and try out the finished version of
// what they will be building.

[role='command']
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/master/trywhatyoubuild-intro.adoc[]
// This include adoc will have the subheading "Try what you'll build".
// If you are not using this command include statement, you'll need to add it as a subheading,
// ie, "=== Try what you'll build".

// Brief explanation on how to use the finished application.
// Describe what user expects to see after running the complete version of the application.

[role='command']
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/master/trywhatyoubuild-end.adoc[]




== Section title for this section, starting with a gerund like Creating, Building, etc

// Add the various sections that are needed for a particular guide.

// Start each additional section title with a meaningful gerund such as Creating, Building, Testing.
// Follow the gerund with a meaningful noun phrase. For example: Creating a JAX-RS application
// Have as many sections and section titles as needed.
// EXAMPLES:

* Building a todo list model

* Creating an application manager

* Creating the JAX-RS Resource


// Write a sentence with the context like "Navigate to the `start` directory to begin." in the section
// where user starts working with the implementation.


// What to add for each section:
// Start each section with a meaningful description about what the user is doing in the section.
// Include code snippets.
// Avoid making all the documentation a series of steps and tasks, bullets, or numbered lists.
// Use tick marks around directories, files, values, class names, method names, and so on.
// Example: `this-is-a-file`, `this/is/a/path`, `thisIsAMethod`.



// EXAMPLE: The following block demonstrates how different sections look like for a todo application.
// ======================================================================================================
== EXAMPLE: Building a todo list model

* Navigate to the `start` directory
* Represent an entry in a todo list

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoModel` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/models/TodoModel.java`
----

TodoModel.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/models/TodoModel.java[]
----

* Getters, setters, and default constructor such that the model can be serialized/deserialized easily

== EXAMPLE: Creating an application manager

* Create a manager that is injected into the JAX-RS resource

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoManager` interface.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todo/managers/TodoManager.java`
----

TodoManager.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/TodoManager.java[]
----

* Next, create the sample todo manager class

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SampleTodoManager` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/samples/SampleTodoManager.java`
----

SampleTodoManager.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/managers/samples/SampleTodoManager.java[]
----

* Implemented basic CRUD ([hotspot=32-36 file=1]`Create`, [hotspot=39-44 file=1]`Read`,
[hotspot=47-57 file=1]`Update`, and [hotspot=60-68 file=1]`Delete`) operations.
* Manager is [hotspot=14 file=1]`ApplicationScoped`, which essentially means that it is a singleton.

== EXAMPLE: Creating the JAX-RS resource

* Description of the technology, possibly with a link to learn more.
* Use CDI to inject the todo manager into the resource

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `TodoResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/resources/TodoResource.java`
----

TodoResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
link:finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/todolistSample/resources/TodoResource.java[]
----

* The resource methods are accessible via HTTP
* Use [hotspot=27-43]`GET`, [hotspot=45-54]`POST`, [hotspot=56-71]`PUT`,
and [hotspot=73-83]`DELETE` verbs to handle reading, creating, updating,
and deleting resources
* Validate data models and send appropriate response accordingly

// Show console output of the test results

// OPTIONAL: after listing the test results, mention a simple change a user can make/introduce that
// will cause the tests to fail. Be brief and don't give the users all of the instructions.
// At this point, they should be comfortable enough to figure it out on their own.




== Great work! You're done!

// Briefly summarize what the user achieved in this guide (1-2 sentences).
EXAMPLE: You have just completed building a simple todo list application using JAXRS and CDI services in Open Liberty.
